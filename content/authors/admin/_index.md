Hello there! My name is Ian Ruginski, and welcome to my small piece of the digital frontier. I am a cognitive scientist interested in applied spatial cognition research. I am currently working under [Dr. Sara Irina Fabrikant](http://visualizegeo.info/) on the [GeoViSense Project](http://wordpress.geovisense.info/wordpress/) as a part of the [Geographic Information Visualization and Analysis (GIVA) group](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/giva.html) and [Digital Society Initiative](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of ZÃ¼rich.

Trained as a cognitive scientist, I use interdisciplinary approaches from psychology, anthropology, statistics, computer science, and geography to study visual processing, spatial cognition, and navigation. From an applied perspective, my research investigates interactions between users and technologies with the goal of better designing computer systems for user interactivity.
